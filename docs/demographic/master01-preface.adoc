= Preface

== Purpose

This document describes the architecture of the openEHR Demographic Information Model. The semantics are drawn from previous work in {openehr_gehr}[GEHR^], existing models in {iso_13606}[ISO 13606^] and the {hl7v3_rim}[HL7v3 RIM], and other work done in Australia.

The intended audience includes:

* Standards bodies producing health informatics standards;
* Academic groups using openEHR;
* The open source healthcare community;
* Solution vendors;
* Medical informaticians and clinicians interested in health information.

== Conformance

Conformance of a data or software artifact to an openEHR specification is determined by a formal test of that artifact against the relevant openEHR Implementation Technology Specification(s) (ITSs), such as an IDL interface or an XML-schema. Since ITSs are formal derivations from underlying models, ITS conformance indicates model conformance.
