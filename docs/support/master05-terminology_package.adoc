= Terminology Package

== Overview

This section describes the terminology package, which contains classes for accessing terminologies
and code sets, including the openEHR Support Terminology, from within instances of classes
defined in the reference model. The classes shown here would normally be inherited via the classes
`EXTERNAL_ENVIRONMENT_ACCESS` and `OPENEHR_DEFINITIONS`, although the exact details of
how this is done may vary depending on implementation language.

== Service Interface

=== Code Sets

A simple terminology service interface is defined according to FIGURE 6, enabling openEHR code
sets and terminology to be referenced formally from within the Reference Model. Two types of coded
entities are distinguished in openEHR, and are accessible via the service interface. The first is codes
from 'code sets', which are the kind of terminology where the code stands for itself, such as the ISO
639-1 language codes. The identifiers themselves of these code sets do not appear to be standardised,
but names such as "ISO_639-1" are expected to be used (see below).

In any case, code sets needed within the openEHR models themselves (e.g. for attributes whose value
is a language code) are not referred to directly by an external name such as "ISO_639-1", but via an
internal constant, in this case, the constant Code_set_id_languages, whose value is defined to be "languages".
These constants are defined in the class `OPENEHR_CODE_SET_IDENTIFIERS` in the UML diagram. 
The mapping between the internal identifiers and external names should be done in configuration
files. The service function `TERMINOLOGY_SERVICE`.`_code_set_for_id()_` is used to retrieve code sets
on the basis of a constant. The current mapping and external identifiers assumed in openEHR is
defined in the openEHR Support Terminology document. This use of indirection is employed to
ensure that the obsoleting and superseding of code-sets does not directly affect openEHR software.

For code sets not mapped to internally used constants, i.e. code sets not required in the openEHR
model itself, but otherwise known in the terminology service, the function
`TERMINOLOGY_SERVICE`.`_code_set()_` can be used to retrieve these code sets by their external identifier.

=== Terminologies

Terminologies, including the openEHR Support Terminology are accessed via the
`TERMINOLOGY_SERVICE` functions `_terminology()_` and `_terminology_identifiers()_`, where the argument
includes "openehr", "centc251" (for CEN TC/251codes) and names from the US NLM terminologies
list (see below). The openEHR Terminology supports groups, and the set of groups required by the
reference model is defined in the class `OPENEHR_TERMINOLOGY_GROUP_IDENTIFIERS`. These
groups correspond to coded attributes found in the openEHR Reference Model.

=== Terms and Codes in the openEHR Reference Model

True coded attributes in the Reference Model (i.e. attributes of type `DV_CODED_TEXT`), such as
`FEEDER_AUDIT`.change_type are defined by an invariant in the enclosing class, such as the following:

----
Change_type_valid: terminology (Terminology_id_openehr).has_code_for_group_id
    (Group_id_audit_change_type, change_type.defining_code)
----

This is a formal way of saying that the attribute change_type must have a value such that its
defining_code (its `CODE_PHRASE`) is in the set of `CODE_PHRASEs` in the openEHR Terminology
which are in the group whose indentifier is `Group_id_audit_change_type`.

A similar invariant is used for attributes of type `CODE_PHRASE`, which come from a `_code_set_`. The
following invariant appears in the class `ENTRY` (`rm.composition.content.entry package`):

----
Language_valid: media_type /= Void and then code_set (Code_set_languages).has_code (language)
----

== Identifiers

In openEHR, the identifier of a terminology or code set is found in the `_terminology_id_` attribute of the
class `CODE_PHRASE` (Data Types Information Model, `text` package).

=== Code Set Identifiers

Internal code set identifiers (such as "languages") used in openEHR are defined in the class
`OPENEHR_CODE_SET_IDENTIFIERS`; assumed external identifiers (such as "ISO_639-1") for code
sets used by the openEHR Reference Model are defined in the openEHR Support Terminology document.

=== Terminology Identifiers

Valid identifiers that can be used for this attribute for terminologies include but are not limited to the
following:

* "openehr"
* "centc251"
* an identifier value from the first column of the US National Library or Medicine (NLM) UMLS terminology identifiers table below, in either of two forms:
** as is, e.g. "ICD10AM_2000", "ICPC93";
** with any trailing section starting with an underscore removed, e.g. "ICD10AM".

Other identification schemes are used in some standards, such as ISO Oids. These are not specified
for direct use in openEHR for various reasons:

* they are not currently used by the NLM, and no definitive published list of terminology
identifiers is available;
* ISO Oids are long identifiers and may significantly increase the size of persisted information
due to the ubiquity of coded terms;
* determing the identity of the terminology in data always requires a request to a service containing
the Oid / name mapping;
* there is a safety factor in having human readable terminology identifiers in the data.

The use of Oid-based or other terminology identification schemes is not however incompatible with
openEHR; all that is required is a terminology identifier / name mapping service or table.

The following table is a snapshot of the US National Library of Medicine UMLS terminology identifiers
list. A definitive up-to-date list may be found on the {nlm_umls_list}[NLM website^].
