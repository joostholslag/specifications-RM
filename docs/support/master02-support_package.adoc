= Support Package

== Overview

The Support Reference Model comprises types used throughout the openEHR models, including
assumed primitive types defined outside of openEHR. The package structure is illustrated below. 
The `assumed_types` 'pseudo-package' stands for types assumed by the openEHR specifcations
to exist in an implementation technology, such as a programming language, schema language or database
environment. The four Support packages define the semantics respectively for constants, terminology
access, access to externally defined scientific units and conversion information. The class
`EXTERNAL_ENVIRONMENT_ACCESS` is a mixin class providing access to the service interface classes.
