=== Requirements

Identification of entities both in the real world and in information systems is a non-trivial problem.
The needs for identification across systems in a health information environment include the following:

* real world identifiers such as social security numbers, veterans affairs ids etc can be
recorded as required by health care facilities, enterprise policies, or legislation;
* identifiers for informational entities which represent real world entities or processes should
be unique;
* it should be possible to determine if two identifiers refer to information entities that represent
the same real world entity, even if instances of the information entities are maintained
in different systems;
* versions or changes to real-world entity-linked informational entities (which may create
new information instances) should be accounted for in two ways:
** it should be possible to tell if two identifiers refer to distinct versions of the same
informational entity in the same version tree;
** it should not be possible to confuse same-named versions of informational entities
maintained in multiple systems which purport to represent the same real world
entity. E.g. there is no guarantee that two systems' "latest" version of the Person
"Dr Jones" is the same.
** Medico-legal use of information relies on previous states of information being
distinguishable from other previous states and the current state.
* It should be possible for an entity in one system or service (such as the EHR) to refer to an
entity in another system or service in such a way that:
** the target of the reference is easily finable within the shared environment, and
** the reference does is valid regardless of the physical architecture of servers and
applications.

The following subsections describe some of the features and challenges of identification.

==== Identification of Real World Entities (RWEs)
Real world entities such as people, car engines, invoices, and appointments can all be assigned identifiers.
Although many of these are designed to be unique within a jurisdiction, they are often not, due
to data entry errors, bad design (ids that are too small or incorporate some non-unique characteristic
of the identified entities), bad process (e.g. non-synchronised id issuing points); identity theft (e.g. via
theft of documents of proof or hacking). In general, while some real world identifiers (RWIs) are
"nearly unique", none can be guaranteed so. It should also be the case that if two RWE identifiers are
equal, they refer to the same RWE, but this is often not the case. For practical purposes, RWIs cannot
be regarded as computationally safe for making the inferences described here.

==== Identification of Informational Entities (IEs)
As soon as information systems are used to record facts about RWEs, the situation becomes more
complex because of the intangible nature of information. In particular:

* the same RWE can be represented simultaneously on more than one system ('spatial multiplicity');
* the same RWE may be represented by more than one "version" of the same IE in a system ('temporal multiplicity').

At first sight, it appears that there can also be _purely_ informational entities, i.e. IEs which do not refer
to any RWE, such as books, online-only documents and software. However, as soon as one considers
an example it becomes clear that there is always a notional 'definitive' or 'authoritative' (i.e. trusted)
version of every such entity. These entities can better be understood as 'virtual RWEs'. Thus it can
still be said that multiple IEs may refer to any given RWE.

The underlying reason for the multiplicity of IEs is that 'reality' - time and space - in computer systems
is not continuous but discrete, and each 'entity' is in fact just a snapshot of certain attribute values
of a RWE, at a point in time, in a particular system. If identifiers are assigned to IEs without
regard to versions or duplicates, then no assertion can be made about the identified RWE when two
IE ids are compared.

==== Identification of Versions
The notion of 'versioning' applies only to informational entities, i.e. distinct instances of content each
representing a snapshot of some logical entity. Where such instances are stored and managed in versioned
containers within a versioning system of some kind, explicit identification of the versions is
required. The requirements are discussed in detail in the Common IM, `change_control` package.

They can be summarised as follows:

* it must be possible to distinguish two versions of the same logical entity, i.e. know from the
identifier if they are the same or different versions of the same thing;
* it must be possible to distinguish two versions of the same logical entity created in two distinct
systems;
* it must be possible to tell the relationship between the items in a versioned lineage, from the
version identifiers.

==== Referencing of Informational Entities
Within a distributed information environment, there is a need for entities not connected by direct references
in the same memory space to be able to refer to each other. There are two competing requirements:
* that the separation of objects in a distributed computing environment not compromise the
semantics of the model;
* that different types of information can be managed relatively independently; for example
EHR and demographic information can be managed by different groups in an organisation
or community, each with at least some freedom to change implementation and model
details.

== Design

This package models only informational identifiers, i.e. transparent identifiers understood by
openEHR or related computational systems. Real World Entity Identifiers such as driver's license
numbers are modelled using the data type `DV_IDENTIFIER`. This is not to imply that such identifiers
are any less systematic or well-managed than the system identifiers defined here, only that from the
point of view of openEHR, they have the same status as other informational attributes such as name,
address etc of a Person.

A key design decision has been to choose a string representation for all identifiers, with subparts
being made available by appropriate functions which perform simple parsing on the string. This
ensures that the data representation of identifiers (e.g. in XML) is as small as possible, while not losing
object-oriented typing.

=== Primitive Identifiers

Three kinds of types are defined in this package. The abstract UID type and its subtypes correspond to
permanent, computationally reliable, primitive identifiers. Such identifiers are regarded as 'primitive'
because they are treated as having no further internal structure, in the sense that part of such an identifier
is not in general meaningful. The three subtypes `UUID`, `ISO_OID` and `INTERNET_ID` all have
these properties, and are commonly accepted ways of uniquely identifying entities in computer systems.
In openEHR (and generally in health informatics) they are usually used as parts of other identifiers.

A consequence of the string representation approach used in these classes is that to set an attribute of
type UID from a string value, as would be done when reading from a database, deserialising from
XML or another text form, a piece of code that inspects the string structure has to be used in order to
decide which of the subtypes of `UID` it is. This is a safe thing to do, since all three subtypes have
mutually exclusive string patterns, and can easily be distinguished.

=== Composite Identifiers

The `OBJECT_ID` type and its hierarchy of subtypes define all of the identifier types used within
openEHR systems. Most of these have a multi-part structure, and some are 'meaningful' i.e. human
readable. The identifier types can be used to represent identifier values that fall into two groups
semantically: those defined by openEHR (which may incorporate generic standard identifiers, such as
ISO Oids etc) and those defined by external organisations. The groups are as shown in the following
table. Identifiers whose form is defined by the `HIER_OBJECT_ID` type are used both by openEHR
and many other organisations.

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
|openEHR-defined identifiers |Externally defined identifiers
|`OBJECT_VERSION_ID`    |`TERMINOLOGY_ID`
|`ARCHEYTPE_ID`         |`GENERIC_ID`
|`TEMPLATE_ID`          |`HIER_OBJECT_ID`
|`HIER_OBJECT_ID`       |
|===

==== UID-based Identifiers

The abstract type `UID_BASED_ID` and its two subtypes `HIER_OBJECT_ID` and
`OBJECT_VERSION_ID` provide respectively, UID-based identifiers for non-versioned and versioned
items. The design of the latter subtype is explained in the openEHR Common IM, change_control
package.

==== Archetype Identifiers

The `ARCHETYPE_ID` subtype defines a multi-axial identifier for archetypes, meaning that each identifier
instance denotes a single archetype within a multi-dimensional space. The space is can be thought
of as 3-dimensional, or as a versioned 2-dimensional space, consisting of the following axes:

* reference model entity, i.e. target of archetype, defined as:
** name of model issuer;
** name of model (there may be more than one from the same issuer);
** name of concept in model, i.e. class name
* domain concept;
* version.

The three outer sections are delimited by '.' characters, while the parts of the first section are delimited
by '-' characters. As with any multi-axial identifier, the underlying principle of an archetype
identifier is that all parts of the identifier must be able to be considered immutable. This means that no
variable characteristic of an archetype (e.g. accrediting authority, which might change due to later
accreditation by another authority, or may be multiple) can be included in its identifier. The explicit
inclusion of version as part of the identifier means that two 'versions' of an archetype are actually two
distinct archetypes. (The rules for archetype versions, revisions and other variants are given in the
{openehr_am_id}[openEHR Archetype Identification specification^].)

Examples of archetype identifiers include:

* `openEHR-EHR-SECTION.physical_examination.v2`
* `openEHR-EHR-SECTION.physical_examination-prenatal.v1`
* `Hl7-RIM-Act.progress_note.v1`
* `openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.progress_note-naturopathy.v2`

The grammar of archetype identifiers is given below in <<Archetype Id Syntax>>.

WARNING:some archetype authoring tools have historically allowed a nonconforming version part within archetype identifiers which included the lifecycle status. This has led to some archetypes having an identifier whose version part is of the form '.v1draft' or similar. The openEHR Foundation will publish guidelines and a timeline on its website for dealing with this problem. New and existing archetype tools may have to support this exception, depending on where they are to be used, and it is recommended that it at least be supported via a command line switch or option. Where such non-conforming archetypes are re-used within a new environment, the identifier should be corrected.

==== Template Identifiers
The template identifier is similar in intention to the achetype identifier - it provides a multi-axial,
readable identifier in addition to any UID-style of identifier that may be used. In this release, the
exact structure has not been defined, but a current proposal is as follows:

* authoring organisation reverse domain name;
* identifier of reference model class being templated;
* logical name of the template;
* version identifier in the form 'vn' where n is a numerical version identifier.

This would lead to identifiers like the following:

* `uk.nhs.cfh:openehr-EHR-COMPOSITION.admission_ed.v5`

A firm form of template identifiers will be described in a future release.

==== Terminology Identifiers
The `TERMINOLOGY_ID` subtype defines a globally unique single string identifier for terminologies.
Terminology identifier values may include a version, either as part of the name, and/or according to
the syntax defined in section 4.3.12 below. Examples of terminology identifiers include:

* "SNOMED-CT"
* "ICD9(1999)"

Currently the best authoritative source for the name part of the identifier (i.e. the part excluding the
optional version part in parentheses) is the US National Library of Medicine UMLS identifiers for
included terminologies - see http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/metaa1.html.

The scheme defined by the `TERMINOLOGY_ID` class provides for the situation where major 'versions'
of a terminology such as the World Health Organisation's 'ICD10' and 'ICD10AM' (AM = 'Australian
modifications') can accommodate a finer grain of versioning or revisioning, e.g.:

* "ICD10AM(3rd_ed)"
* "ICD10AM(4th_ed)"

The version part of a terminology identifier is in theory only absolutely necessary for those terminologies
which break the rule that the concept being identified with a code loses or changes its meaning
over versions of the terminology. This should not be the case for modern terminologies and ontologies,
particularly those designed since the publication of Cimino's 'desiderata' [Doc No:] of which
the principle of 'concept permanance' is applicable here - "A concept's meaning cannot change and it
cannot be deleted from the vocabulary". However, there may be older terminologies, or specialised
terminologies which may not have obeyed these rules, but which are still used; version ids should
always be used for these. At a practical level, versions may be included routinely in some systems to
support the potential medico-legal need to prove that a) a given code was in fact defined in the terminology
(it may not have existed in an earlier edition) and b) that the meaning assmued in the system
was indeed the one assigned to it in the particular version or edition.

==== Equivalence
Although there are anomalies in some published terminologies and between some versions or editions
of the same terminology, two terminology identifiers that are the same, disregarding the version part,
can usually be considered as semantic equivalents in the terminology world. However, depending on
which source of strings have been chosen for the name part of the identifier, two different identifiers
may also indicate the same terminology, e.g. "ICD10AM_2000" (NLM identifier used in UMLS) and
"ICD10AM(2nd_ed)" refer to the same thing.

==== Identifying Versions within openEHR Versioned Containers
The `OBJECT_VERSION_ID` defines the semantics of the scheme used in openEHR for identifying
versions within a versioned container, and uses a three-part identifier, consisting of:

* object_id: the identifier of the version container, in the form of an UID;
* version_tree_id: the location in the version tree, as a 1- or 3-part numeric identifier, where the latter variant expresses branching; this is modelled using the `VERSION_TREE_ID` type;
* creating_system_id: the identifier of the system in which this version was created, or type UID.

Under this scheme, multiple versions in the same container all have the same value for object_id,
while their location in the version tree is given by the combination of the version tree identifier and
the identifier of the creating system.

The requirements on the third part of the identifier are that it be unique per system, and that it be easy
to obtain or generate. It is also helpful if it is a meaningful identifier. The two most practical candidates
appear to be GUIDs (which are not meaningful, but are easy to generate) and reverse internet
domain identifiers, as recommended in [3] (these are easy to determine if the system has an internet
address, and are meaningful and directly processible, however unconnected systems pose a problem).
ISO Oids might also be used. All of these identifier types are accommodated via the use of UID.
A full explanation of the version identification scheme and its capabilities is given in the
`change_control` section of the Common IM.

==== Generic and External Identifiers
The `GENERIC_ID` type provides for identifiers of schemes other than defined concretely in the
`rm.support.identification` package. It has a single method scheme, which may be used to
record the identifier type. The names of schemes are not currently controlled.

==== Hierarchical Identifiers
The `HIER_OBJECT_ID` type is defined to support hierarchical identifiers, often based on ISO Oids or
other similar machine-readable and -resolvable schemes.

==== Composite Identifiers and Case
All composite identifiers should follow two rules with regard to case, namely:

* to be case-preserving - not change case due to persistence, copying, transfer or other computation
processes;
* to be case-insensitive - two identifiers identical apart from case are considered to be identical,
and therefore to identify the same thing.

The practical consequences of these rules are as follows:

* mixed-case identifiers may be used, such as archetype identifiers, mixed-case reverse
domain identifiers (the `INTERNET_ID` type);
* the original case chosen in the letters of identifiers on creation within an openEHR system
should be as published by the relevant issuing organisation (e.g. NLM UMLS terminology
names are all upper case);
* if identifiers are used as part of filenames within computer file systems, care must be taken
to create and preserve filenames correctly. For this reason, software usually has to handle
filename creation and modification differently on Unix-style operating systems, which are
case-sensitive (and therefore case-preserving), and Windows-style operating systems, which
are case-insensitive but usually case-preserving.

These rules do not apply to any identifier constructed in a language in which case does not exist as a
concept. For this reason, for identifiers translated in and out of the Turkish language (and possibly in
smaller related languages), care must be taken with the 'I/i' characters.

==== Composite Identifiers and Language
In all of the 'meaningful' identifier types above, with the posible exception of `GENERIC_ID`, the
human-readable identifier sections are assumed to use only the basic latin character set, possibly with
the addition of other special characters as allowed by the production rules defined below for each
identifier. In most cases, the textual parts of these identifiers will be words from the English language,
or else they will be recognisable words from other languages, where necessary alliterated into the
latin alphabet. Accented and other diacritical letter variants are not allowed. This limitation is made in
the interests of practical computability of identifiers, and is in common with class and attribute naming in shared UML models in the standards world, and also with internet domain names and internet
URIs.

=== References

All `OBJECT_IDs` are used as identifier attributes within the thing they identify, in the same way as a
database primary key. To refer to an identified object from another object, an instance of the class
`OBJECT_REF` should generally be used, in the same way as a database foreign key. The class
`OBJECT_REF` is provided as a means of distributed referencing, and includes the object namespace
(typically 1:1 with some service, such as "terminology") and type. The general principle of object references
is to be able to refer to an object available in a particular namespace or service. Usually they
are used to refer to objects in other services, such as a demographic entity from within an EHR, but
they may be used to refer to local objects as well. The type may be the concrete type of the referred-to
object (e.g. "GP") or any proper ancestor (e.g. `PARTY`).

== Syntaxes

According to IETF RFC1034, the syntax of a domain name follows the EBNF grammar:

[source, ebnf]
--------
domain = subdomain | ' ' ;
subdomain = label | subdomain '.' label ;
label = letter [ [ ldh-str ] let-dig ] ;
ldh-str = let-dig-hyp | let-dig-hyp ldh-str ;
let-dig-hyp = let-dig | '-' ;
let-dig = letter | digit ;
letter = ; (* any one of the 52 alphabetic characters A through Z in upper case and a through z in lower case *)
digit = ; (* any one of the ten digits 0 through 9 *)
--------

It can also be expressed using the regular expression:

--------
[a-zA-Z]([a-zA-Z0-9-]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?(\.[a-zA-Z]([a-zA-Z0-9-]*[a-zA-Z0-9]))*
--------

=== Identifier Syntax
The syntax of the value attribute by default follows the following production rules (EBNF):

[source, ebnf]
--------
value = root [ '::' extension ] ;
root = uid ; (* -- see UID above *)
extension = ; (* any string *)
--------

=== OBJECT_VERSION_ID Identifier Syntax
The string form of an `OBJECT_VERSION_ID` stored in its value attribute consists of three segments
separated by double colons ("::"), i.e. (EBNF):

[source, ebnf]
--------
value = object_id '::' creating_system_id '::' version_tree_id ;
object_id = uid ; -- see UID below
creating_system_id = uid ; -- see UID below
version_tree_id = -- see `VERSION_TREE_ID` below
--------

An example is as follows:

----
F7C5C7B7-75DB-4b39-9A1E-C0BA9BFDBDEC::87284370-2D4B-4e3d-A3F3-F303D2F4F34B::2
----

=== VERSION_TREE_ID Syntax
The format of the value attribute is (EBNF):

[source, ebnf]
--------
value = trunk_version [ '.' branch_number '.' branch_version ] ;
trunk_version = { digit }+ ;
branch_number = { digit }+ ;
branch_version = { digit }+ ;
digit = [0-9] ;
--------

=== Archetype ID Syntax
The syntax of an `ARCHETYPE_ID` is formally defined as follows:

[source, ebnf]
--------
archetype_id = qualified_rm_entity '.' domain_concept '.' version_id ;
qualified_rm_entity = rm_originator '-' rm_name '-' rm_entity ;
rm_originator = V_ALPHANUMERIC_NAME ;
rm_name = V_ALPHANUMERIC_NAME ;
rm_entity = V_ALPHANUMERIC_NAME ;
domain_concept = concept_name { '-' specialisation }* ;
concept_name = V_ALPHANUMERIC_NAME ;
specialisation = V_ALPHANUMERIC_NAME ;
version_id = 'v' V_NONZERO_DIGIT [ V_NUMBER ] ;

V_ALPHANUMERIC_NAME = [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]+ ;
V_NONZERO_DIGIT = [1-9] ;
V_NUMBER = [0-9]+ ;
--------

The field meanings are as follows:

* `_rm_originator_` = id of organisation originating the reference model on which this archetype is based;
* `_rm_name_` = id of the reference model on which the archetype is based;
* `_rm_entity_` = ontological level in the reference model;
* `_domain_concept_` = the domain concept name, including any specialisations;
* `_version_id_` = numeric version identifier.

The PERL regular expression equivalent of the above is as follows:

----
[a-zA-Z]\w+(-[a-zA-Z]\w+){2}\.[a-zA-Z]\w+(-[a-zA-Z]\w+)*\.v[1-9]\d*
----

The classic regular expression equivalent of this is generated from the above with the following substitutions:

----
\w -> [a-zA-Z0-9_]
\d -> [0-9]
----

=== Terminology Identifier Syntax
The syntax of the value attribute is as follows:

[source, ebnf]
--------
terminology_id = name [ '(' version ')' ] ;
name = V_NAME ;
version = V_VERSION ;

V_NAME = ? [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-/+]+ ; (* regex equivalent *)
V_VERSION = ? [a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-/.]+ ? ; (* regex equivalent *)
--------
