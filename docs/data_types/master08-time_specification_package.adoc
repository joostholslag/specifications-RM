= Time_specification Package

== Overview
Time specification is about potentiality rather than actuality, and needs its own types. The openEHR
`data_types.time_specification` package provides such types, based on the HL7 types of the
same names, and is illustrated below.

=== Requirements
One of the difficulties with time is expressing future times, since potential occurrences, durations,
repetitions cannot be expressed in the same way as actual time. Complicating the problem is the fact
that humans tend to use very customary (i.e. calendar-anchored) ways of specifying time, such as
"every second Tuesday", or "the first Sunday of the month". In clinical medicine, future time is most
commonly used to express when medications or other therapies are intended to take place. They are
often anchored to the calendar, and can easily include repetitions.

As with other time types, there are both simple and complex cases to consider. One of the most common
examples of time in the future is the timing for drug administrations, e.g. "once every four
hours". This could be represented as a simple periodic specification, consisting of a start point in
time, a period, and a number of repetitions. The specification for taking blood sugar levels during a
glucose test could be represented as a simple aperiodic series, e.g. ".5hr, 1hr, 2hr". However, even
common specifications for prescriptions e.g. "three times a day for seven days" start to become quite
complex, for example, because "three times a day" might not mean literally 8 hours apart.

Some of the factors to consider in timing specifications are:

* period of repetition
* duration of activity being specified
* possible alignment to the calendar, e.g. "every 5th of the month"
* possible alignment to real world events e.g. "after meals"
* fuzziness

Because time is inherently "messy" (months do not all have the same number of days, leap years
change the number of days in some years etc), and because the relationship we have with time can
also be arbitrary (e.g. anchored to mealtimes etc), specifying linguistically obvious specifications formally
is quite challenging.

=== Design

The HL7 version 3 data types for time specification appear to allow for all of the required possibilities.
The syntax is based on the {iso_8601}[ISO 8601 standard^]. It provides types which express:

* Periodic intervals (HL7v3 - `PIVL<T:TS>`) - allows period, duration, and calendar linking to
be specified.
* Event-linked periodic intervals (HL7v3 - `EIVL<T:TS>`) - allows PIVLs to be linked to realworld
events like meals.
* General timing specification (HL7v3 - GTS) - allows any time specification to be expressed,
using a syntax which is equivalet to a series of `IVL<TS>` (i.e. intervals of `DATE_TIME`).

The HL7 syntax for time specification is encapsulated in equivalent openEHR types described here.

== Syntaxes

=== Phase-linked Time Specification Syntax

The syntactic form of phase-linked periodic time specifications (derived from the `PIVL<T>` spec
HL7v3 ballot) is as follows.

----
"[" interval "]" "/" "(" difference ")" [ "@" alignment ] [ "IST" ]
----

Examples include:

----
* [200004181100;200004181110]/(7d)@DW = every Tuesday from 11:00 to 11:10 AM.
* [200004181100;200004181110]/(1mo)@DM" = every 18th of the month 11:00 to 11:10 AM.
----

A parse specification is as follows:

[source, ebnf]
--------
phase_linked_time_spec = pure_phase_linked_time_spec [ "IST" ] ;
pure_phase_linked_time_spec = phase [ "@" alignment ] ;
phase = interval "/" "(" difference ")" ;
alignment = "DW" | etc ;                  (* terms from "HL7::CalendarCycle" domain *)
difference =  ;                           (* ISO 8601 for time difference *)
interval = "[" interval_spec "]" ;
interval_spec = ";" | ";" date_time | date_time ";" date_time | date_time ";" ;
date_time = (* ISO 8601 for date/time string yyyymmdd[hh[mm[ss]]] *) ;
--------

=== Event-linked Periodic Time Specification Syntax
Examples of event-linked periodic time specifications include:

* "PC+[1h;1h]" = one hour after meal
* "HS-[50min;1h]" = one hour before bedtime for 10 minutes

The following parse specification defines the syntax for event-related periodic time specifications.

[source, ebnf]
--------
event_linked_time_spec = event | event offset ;
event = "AC" | "ACD" | etc ;             (* HL7 domain "HL7::TimingEvent" *)
offset = ( "+" | "-" ) dur_interval ;
dur_interval = ;                         (* ISO 8601 for duration interval *)
--------

=== General Time Specification Syntax
The class is the same structurally as the `DV_TIME_SPECIFICATION` parent. The syntax is the HL7
GTS syntax, defined by the following parse specification:

[source, ebnf]
--------
general_time_spec = symbol | union | exclusion ;
union = intersection  [";" union ] ;
exclusion = exclusion "\" intersection ;
intersection = factor intersection | factor ;
hull = factor [ ".." hull ] ;
factor = interval | phase_linked_time_spec | event_linked_time_spec | "(" general_time_spec ")" ;
--------
