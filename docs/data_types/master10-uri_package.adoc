= Uri Package

== Overview
The `data_types.uri` package includes two types used for referring to information resources. The
`DV_URI` type allows data values which are references to objects on the world wide web to be created.
Its specialisation, `DV_EHR_URI`, enables any element in an openEHR record to be identified in the
same way as other objects on the web. The `DV_EHR_URI` type is convenient, because it is a string,
like any other URI, and is therefore easily transportable and processable. Because it has its own
scheme space, "ehr", instances can be globally unique, as long as EHR identification is globally
unique. `DV_EHR_URIs` are used to express all runtime paths in the EHR. The uri Package is illustrated
below.

=== Requirements
This package meets the requirement for a `DATA_VALUE` subtype which represents a W3C Uniform
Resource Identifier (URI). A common example of where this might be used is to represent a reference
to a clinical guideline or other justifying document associated with an intervention or treatment plan
recorded in the EHR.

URIs are a superset of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) (although the two are often confused,
even within the W3C), and can be used to specify the location of any information item, regardless of
its type, location or storage method, as long as a URI "scheme" exists for that type of information.

There is an additional requirement for a kind of URI that can point at an EHR data item, either inside
the same EHR containing the link, or in another EHR. This is the basis of implementing the `LINK`
type.

=== Design
A simple design approach is used whereby a URI is represented as a String, and appropriate functions
are defined to extract the various parts according to the syntax of URIs defined by Tim Berners-Lee
{rfc3986}[IETF RFC 3986^]. An EHR specific subtype is defined, whose scheme is
"ehr", and which contains further attributes enabling the instances of the type to record what kind of
object they are referring to.

== Definitions
The following symbolic definitions are used in the classes below.

* _Ehr_scheme_: String is "ehr"

== Syntaxes

=== DV_EHR_URI Syntax

The syntax of a `DV_EHR_URI` is an openEHR path, inside the "ehr" URI scheme-space, and is of the
form:

----
"ehr://" ehr_path
----

The syntax of ehr_path is described in the section on Paths in The openEHR Architecture Overview
document. `DV_EHR_URI`s are used as a mechanism for referencing in the EHR, ensuring readability
by humans, as well as validity when extracts are transmitted elsewhere: even if the target of a path is
not present, the path can be used to locate the missing item on demand.
