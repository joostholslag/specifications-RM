= Comparison with HL7v3 Types

== Scope
Some HL7v3 types are not modelled in openEHR. HL7v3 V3DT types which are assumed by
openEHR to exist in the underlying type system of any implementation technology include:

* Integer (`INT`)
* Real (`REAL`)
* Set (`SET`)
* List (`LIST`)
* Bag (`BAG`)

HL7v3 types which are not modelled here because they are almost always too volatile for concrete
modelling, and can be created with archetyped generic information structures are as follows (even in
HL7 they are really data structures rather than data types):

* Postal address (`AD`)
* Entity name (`EN`)
* Person name (`PN`)
* Organisation name (`ON`)
* Trivial name (`TN`)

These types are all modelled by archetyped spatial data structures in openEHR (equivalent to subtypes
of Structure in the CDA specification).
HL7v3 types which may need to be modelled in the future include:

* Uncertain value probabilistic (`UVP`)
* Non-parametric probability distribution (`NPPD`)
* Parametric probability distribution (`PPD`)

Types which are provided by openEHR but not supported directly by HL7 include:

* state variable (`DV_STATE`);
* ordinal values (`DV_ORDINAL`);
* explicit partial date and time types (`DV_DATE`, `DV_TIME`);
* explicit time duration (`DV_DURATION`).

Types in the latter two categories may be implementable with the `TS` (timestamp) type.

== Design Differences
There are some significant differences in design approach between the openEHR data types and the
HL7v3 data types, described in the following sections.

=== Naming
All types in the HL7 specification have two names, one short and one long. For example the type representing
physical quantities is known both as "PhysicalQuantity" and "PQ". While short names may
be reasonable for often-used types, someshort names are not obvious, e.g. "EN", "ON", "TN",
"NPPD" etc. Short names certainly have benefits for drawing tools such as Rational Rose or other
UML tools, however, it is questionable whether a formal model should include concept names chosen
on the basis of visual appearance in such tools (one might argue that such tools should provide aliases
for visual purposes, without changing the actual model). Another problem is that UML does not
include the concept of class name aliases, nor do most programming languages.

The openEHR model uses one name only for each class.

=== Identification
The HL7 V3DT includes the types `II`, `UID`, `OID` and `UUID`. The `II` type is claimed to be for identifying
all kinds of entities, which we here classify as real-world entities ("RWEs") (such as people, vehicle
registrations, invoices) and informational entities ("IEs") - which in general are snapshots of data
representing an RWE in a computer system. One problem with RWE identification schemes is that
some are known (e.g. social security number) to produce fallible identifiers or situations where multiple
RWEs have the same identifier, or no identifier at all. Conversely, with well-controlled and internationally
agreed ways of issuing/generating information system identifiers (e.g. GUID, ISO OID) it
is thought that such identifiers can be made reliable, and indeed correspond 1:1 with their intended
IEs. However, a problem with IEs is that there are often duplicates and also multiple versions in time,
each intended to represent the same RWE (such as a particular person, observation or composition).

As far as can be ascertained currently, there is no standard analysis taking into account the existence
of IEs and RWEs, and recognising the fact that multiple versions and/or duplicates may refer to the
same RWE.

The approach taken in openEHR with respect to identifiers is currently as follows.

* RWE identifiers such as social security numbers, licence numbers, etc are modelled with the
type `DV_IDENTIFIER`, which has the attributes:
** `_issuer_`: `String`
** `_id_`: `String`
** `_type_`: `String`
The attributes listed above are nearly the same as for the HL7 II type, indicating that the two
types may be compatible.
* Identification of IEs is done using the type `OBJECT_ID`, which is not a data type, and is documented
in the Support Information Model. The `OBJECT_ID` type takes into account the
fact that there may be multiple IEs referring to the same underlying RWE by adding a version
identifier (assumed to be a timestamp).

=== Archetyping

The openEHR data types are defined on the assumption of archetype-based systems. While they will
work perfectly well in systems which know nothing about archetyping, some types are not defined
because archetypable structures built from more basic entities are assumed instead, rather than concretely
modelled data types. These include 'types' for Address and PersonName which are found in
HL7v3 and ISO 13606.

=== Treatment of Inbuilt Types
The HL7v3 data types do not make any assumptions about the existence of types typically built-in to
most object and relational formalisms, such as the basic types `String`, `Integer`, `Boolean`, `Real`,
`Double`, and the generic types `Set<T>`, `Bag<T>` and `Array<T>`. Hence, the types `ST`, `INT`, `REAL`,
`BL`, `SET<T>`, `BAG<T>` and so on are redefined by HL7. The supposed advantage of this approach is
that the semantics of all types in the HL7 system, right down to atomic data items are self-contained
in the definition, and do not rely on external semantics. Possible problems with this approach include
the following.

* The HL7 definitions diverge from the OMG IDL and ISO 11404 definitions of the basic data
types, which could cause unexpected problems in software development and data processing
which is done in typical development technologies (object-oriented and relational).
* The HL7 types `INT` and `REAL` are defined as subtypes of the `QTY` type, a relationship that
does not exist in any object-oriented formalism for these types (in particular, there is no substitutability
of a type called Integer or Real for a type called Qty built in to any object language).
The definitions of `INT` and `REAL` are also different from those found in most object
formalisms. This might cause some difficulty in implementation.
* The binary data type `BIN` is represented as a `List<BL>` (where each item can be True, False, null), whereas it would normally be expected to be something like `Array<Octet>` (i.e. an array of bytes) in most software environments. There does not appear to be any utility in defining it as `List<BL>`, since binary data is almost without exception represented and processed as contiguous arrays of machine bytes.
* The string type `ST` inherits from the encapsulated data type `ED`, which in turn inherits from the binary data type `BIN`. The result of this is that an instance of `ST` contains numerous data attributes relating to multi-media data, and the content is presumably represented as a `List<BL>`. This is a major departure from the standard understanding of a string in computer sciences, which is usually simply an array of characters.
* The HL7 boolean type `BL` is a three-valued logic type due to the null marker approach (see below), not the usual two-valued type found in the Boolean concept in programming languages. The same is true of `INT` and `REAL:` due to the null marker design, "null" is a possible return value of an integer or real as well as true integer and real values.

In general, where differences exist between same-named types in HL7 and an underlying formalism
such as a programming language, there is likely to be some confusion in implementation. Further,
there is likely to be confusion in how to process instances of basic types which contain numerous
(and sometimes recursive) fields which are not used in the standard specifications of basic types.
The openEHR approach with respect to inbuilt types is to assume only those types found in the mainstream
object-oriented programming languages, and in particular, definitive formalisms like OMG
IDL and XML. While this means there there is in theory less control over these types than in the HL7
approach, the number of types involved is quite small, and the problem of bindings to the basic types
of object formalisms is well understood. Additionally, since it is recognised that some data types
defined by openEHR could clash with types found in some languages and libraries, all data type class
names are prefaced with "DV_" to avoid naming confusion, and to allow implementations of
openEHR types to co-exist with existing types in implementation formalisms.

=== Use of Null Markers

All HL7 data types inherit from the `ANY` class (equivalent to the `DATA_VALUE` class in openEHR)
which contains the attributes:

----
BL nonNull;
CS nullFlavor;
BL isNull;
----

The purpose of these attributes is to indicate whether a datum is Null, and for what reason. Since
some data type classes also appear as the attributes of other data types, the Null markers also indicate
whether any part of a datum is null. Thus, in the class Interval<T> shown below, all attributes have
the possibility of containing a Null marker.

[source, java]
--------
type Interval<T> alias IVL<T> extends Set<T>
{
    T low;
    BL lowClosed;
    T high;
    BL highClosed;
    T.diff width;
    T center;
    IVL<T> hull(IVL<T> x);
    literal ST;
    promotion IVL<T> (T x);
    demotion T;
};
--------

For example, this allows an interval with missing ends and width to exist as a structured type. The
consequence of the approach is that the entire model is essentially a model of "partial" data types;
_any attribute and any function call may return a Null value, as well as the true values of its type_ (in
fact, in the specification, Null values are defined to be valid values of all data types). This design
decision was taken in HL7 so that any datum, no matter how unknown, would be structurally representable
in the same way as completely known data, enabling it to be processed in the same way as all
other instances of the same type.

However, an important object-oriented design principle has been ignored in this approach. In the
proper design of classes, properties and class invariants are stated. Invariants are statements which
describe the correctness conditions of instances of the class; the general rule is that the post-condition
of a creation routine (constructor) of a class must be that the invariants are satisfied. For example, an
invariant of the HL7 `IVL<T>` class could be:

----
(exists(low) and exists(high)) or else
(exists(low) and exists(width)) or else
(exists(width) and exists(high))
----

When an instance of this class is created, this condition should be satisfied, and remain satisfied for
the life of the instance. To do otherwise is to create instances of data which other software can make
no assumptions about, and is forced to check every single field, and then determine what to do in an
ad hoc way. (See citenp:[Meyer_OOSC2] p366, citenp:[Booch1994] p43, citenp:[Kilov1994] p29 for detailed explanations of the invariant concept).
Possible consequences of the built-in Null marker design approach include:

* since even HL7's basic types `ST`, `INT`, `REAL`, `LIST<>`, `SET<>` include null markers, processing
of null values will be pervasive at the lowest level;
* software will be more complex, both implementations of the data types, and of software
which handle them. This is because the software always has to deal with the possibility of
calls to routines and attributes returning Null values. Most clinical information systems to
date have taken the approach that a datum is either represented as an instance of a formal
type if fully known, or else as narrative text if only partial;
* data may not be always be safely processable, since some software may not properly handle
the null values associated with attributes of partially known data items. Essentially, all software
which processes the data has to be "null-value aware", and make no assumptions at all
about whether a particular data instance is valid or not.

The HL7 data type model is in contrast with simpler approaches such as used in CEN, GEHR, and
openEHR, where data types are formal models of types such as Coded_term, Quantity and so on.
Rather than build the possibility of null markers into every attribute and class in the data types, a single
null marker is defined in relevant containing classes. This decision is based on the principle that
data types should be defined independently of their context of use. Hence, where data types are used
as data values, such as in the value attribute of the class `ELEMENT` from the openEHR EHR reference
model, the parallel features is_null and null_flavour are also defined. However, where data types
appear as attributes elsewhere in the model and there is no possibility of them being null, no null
markers are used. The figure below shows visually the difference between the two approaches.

The consequences of the standard software-engineering approach include:

* data types can be more easily formally specified, since the semantics of invariants, attributes and operations do not need to include the possibility of null values;
* software implementations are simpler;
* data are always guaranteed to be safely processable for decision support and general querying, since no instance of a formal type will be created in the first place if the datum is very unreliable;
* null markers only appear in models where they are relevent, rather than everywhere data types are used;
* however, the openEHR data types do not automatically deal with missing or unknown internal attribute values (such as missing high and low values for an interval, partial dates etc).

In order to deal with the last possibility, various approaches are used in openEHR:

* for most data which is not fully known, no data type instance is created, and a null marker is created. Depending on the design of the revelant archetypes, there will usually be the possibility of recording the datum in narrative form;
* `ENTRYs` in the openEHR EHR reference model include a certainty:Boolean attribute, for recording a level of doubt;
* for particular data types which are often partial, special features are defined. The main types affected are `DV_DATE`, `DV_TIME`, and `DV_DATE_TIME`; the properties month_unknown, day_unknown, minute_unknown, and second_unknown (based on ISO 8601 semantics) are used to define explicitly the semantics of dates with a missing day, times with missing seconds and so on;
* Intervals of date/time types include types generated when the parameter type is one of the partial classes, thus, types `DV_INTERVAL<DV_DATE>` (where one or both ends has an unknown part) are possible. This covers the need for intervals in which some date is missing from the end date/times, while not allowing intervals with completely missing items to be created;
* for expressing uncertainy more precisely, probability distribution data types (based on the types defined in HL7) can be used.

A consequence of the HL7 model is that data instances represented in XML or another structured text
format will be structurally the same regardless of whether there are Null values or not. A structured
form for partially known data (which would normally break the invariants of its class) may well be
useful for representing the data as part of a text field, making it easier to use for whatever processing
is possible later on.

=== Terminology Approach
The approach in openEHR is to assume the existence of a Terminology Server which is the sole
authoritative interface with terminologies of any kind, and is the only entity which can assume
responsibility for querying, post-coordination or other manipulations of terms. No allowance is made
for coordination of "modifiers", "qualifiers" or any other terms outside the service. As a consequence,
there are no coordination facilities in the type `DV_CODED_TEXT`, a departure from earlier versions of
the specification - any term provided from the terminology service must already be "coordinated",
either by the terminology service, or by one of the terminologies it accesses. This places the responsibility
of combining terms firmly in the knowledge part of the system, and prevents unsanctioned,
unvalidated combinations being created elsewhere.

=== Date/Time Approach
The HL7 specification uses a single `TS` type to represent all logical dates, times, date/times, and partial
versions thereof. The openEHR specification defines distinct types for each, since these are the
types which occur in the real world, and it is easier to specify correctness constraints with this
approach. It is recognised that a single type may be used by some implementors (depending on what
is available in the language being used), however, the recommended practice is to wrap any such
types with the logical types described in this specification. This approach reduces the possibility for
any errors in transmitted data (since no strange combinations of year, ... , second can occur not explicitly
described in the type definitions).

=== Time Specification Types
The HL7 approach for time specification appears to cover all reasonable requirements, but has some
minor problems, including:

* the types `PIVL` and `EIVL` are declared as being generic types (i.e. `PIVL<T:TS>`,
`EIVL<T:TS>`), when there appears to be no reason for this;
* the `PIVL`.`_phase_` attribute is used to represent an interval during which a activity occurs,
example given is "2 minutes every 8 hours". However, the "2 mins" is almost always part of
a therapeutic prescription of some kind, not part of the timing specification as such. Therapeutic 
prescriptions have the form "do X every Y time", where the X describes what to do,
and how long to do it for (e.g. 40 mins massage, administer a drug slowly over 10 mins). In
fact, what we are really interested in with a timing specification is the specification of the
starting points in time of some activity, not a time-based graph of on/off points, whch is
effectively what the `PIVL` type is now.

=== Type Conversions
The HL7v3 data types specification allows various type conversions, as follows:

    Three kinds of type conversions are defined: promotion, demotion, and character string literals.
    Type conversions can be implicit or explicit. Implicit type conversion occurs when a certain
    type is expected (e.g. as an argument to a statement) but a different type is actually provided.

One notable kind of conversion possible in HL7 is of a value of any type `T` into an instance of
`Set<T>`, `List<T>`, `Bag<T>` or `IVL<T>` containing the value.
The openEHR model does not provide for any type conversions other than those automatically available
between inbuilt basic numeric types such as Integer, Float and Double, and between types
related by inheritance, as supported by all object-oriented languages.
