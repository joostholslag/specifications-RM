= Background

== Scope
The data type specification presented here defines the clinical/scientific data types which are used in
other openEHR models. Harmonisation of data types between information models used by related
services in a health information infrastructure is essential to reducing the conversion work and potential
for errors between these services. Accordingly, the openEHR data type specification is intended to
work not only for the EHR, but also for other models defined by openEHR, such as the openEHR
demographic and terminological models.

The types described here have been derived from data types used in Good Electronic Health Record cite:[GeHR_Aus2001], the Synapses project 
cite:[Synapses_Req_A], and various standards {iso_13606-1}[ISO 13606-1^], {iso_13606-3}[ISO 13606-3^] and {hl7v3_data_types}[HL7v3 Data Types^].

== Design Criteria
Over and above the need to satisfy the functional requirements of clinical data, three concerns have
driven the design of the openEHR data types:

. clarity of expression
. ease of implementation
. interoperability with data types from other standards

The first of these has led to models which try to clearly convey the semantics of types required by the
clinical domain. The use of constraints (pre- and post-conditions and class invariants) and a comprehensible
class structure ensures formal self-consistency, correct type-substitutability and implementability
in object-oriented formalisms. Types have been designed so as not to clash with norms of
object-oriented languages and libraries, in particular, class names and the inbuilt types. Accordingly,
all types presented here have a logical name commencing with `DV_`, ensuring that there is no clash
with a type in the implementation formalism, hence the type `DV_DATE` presented here will not be confused
with the type `DATE` which appears in many programming languages or libraries.

Object-oriented languages which have been considered include IDL, C++, Java, C#, Eiffel, Delphi
and Python. Each of these languages obeys some variant of the well-known semantics of classes,
encapsulation, typing and inheritance. The data types described here follow the tenets of object-orientation
defined in UML most closely, while being careful not to invalidate their implementation in
any language. The models have all been validated by implementation in the Eiffel language, the closest
available semantic fit for UML, and currently the most powerful of mainstream object-oriented
formalisms.

Implementability in XML-schema has also been an important design criterion, and the current data
types remove many of the problems which the GEHR and CEN data types presented for XMLschema.
There has been no attempt to support XML-DTD, since it has no type system, and cannot
reliably be reasoned about in an object-oriented way.

To simplify implementation in all object-oriented formalisms, including IDL, programming languages
and XML-schema, multiple inheritance has generally been avoided (where it is used, only onr
branch corresponds to substitutability). Generic classes have been used, since they significantly clarify
the model. Type genericity is available in Java, C#, Eiffel, C++, and some other languages. For
languages not having it, there is a well-known transformation from models containing generic classes
to classes for non-generic types systems.

Implementability in relational databases has also been considered, and appears relatively straightforward,
since only the data view of the types needs to be represented. Many implementations are likely
to use only a single String or XML string to represent each entire data instance, which significantly
simplifies things.

== Prior Work

Four other type systems for clinical data, namely the GEHR data types, the HL7 v3 data types, the
CEN 13606 data item types, and the Corbamed data types were carefully scrutinised in order to
ensure a) that all needed types were covered in the openEHR specification, and b) that data conversion
will be possible. Concepts from all three are cross-referenced throughout this specification where
possible.

Because the HL7v3 data type specification is a widely available and comprehensive specification for
clinican data types, particular attention has been paid to incorporating its semantics, as well as fixing
errors or shortcomings. While there are differences both in design approach and in detail, a significant
debt must be recognised to the authors of this work, from which many ideas in the present specification
were drawn. A detailed discussion is found under <<Comparison with HL7v3 Types>>.
