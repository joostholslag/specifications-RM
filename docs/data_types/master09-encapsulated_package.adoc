= Encapsulated Package

== Overview
The `data_types.encapsulated` package contains classes representing data values whose internal
structure is defined outside the EHR model, such as multimedia and parsable data. It is illustrated below.

=== Requirements
There is a need to be able to include content in the EHR whose interior structure is not modelled in
the EHR reference model, but instead documented by sufficient meta-data attributes for specific tools
to process the data. Types of content in this category are as follows.

* Images, including images which are themselves a compressed version of one image from a
high-resolution image set stored elsewhere. Such images may be in any of the well-known
compressed or uncompressed formats, and may have their own thumbnail image attached, to
facilitate web-viewing.
* Bio-signal data series, such as a set of values representing a diagnostic part of an ECG trace.
This might be represented as DICOM content.
* Content which is textual (or nearly so) which is essentially a parsable language file of some
kind. This includes all XML instance, HTML, and any other EHR content which happens to
be represented in syntax form - such as the unit strings used in quantities. The name of the
formalism should be stored as meta-data.
* Binary content which is processed by a work processor or other dedicated tool.
* Digital signatures.

Sufficient meta-data must be included with all of these types to enable a way for the content to be
processed, typically by indicating either its type (e.g. "jpeg", "word document") or the name of a tool
which can be used to process it. Important meta-data include:

* size of the content;
* natural language, if any.

Any encapsulated data item may be a summary, "thumbnail" or otherwise reduced form of an original
content item found outside the EHR, in some other system or file-system.
Checksums must be expressible for those items for which a checksum is available, or for which the
system generates checksums to improve the quality of its internal data transmissions.

=== Design
The design approach used here is based on the following analysis.

. Any encapsulated data item may be in some particular language, even if it is an image or other graphic form such as a biosignal with axis markings in a particular language;
. The general structure of encapsulated content data items includes a block of bytes or characters representing the content, and various meta-data as appropriate, including:
** size
** character encoding
** compression type/algorithm
** name of formalism for parsable content
. For encapsulated items that have a counterpart in another system, the standard means of portable address is the W3C URI;
. For items may that have an associated integrity checksum, the checksum is itself a series of bytes, and the type of checksum must also be specified, e.g. "md5".

These observations lead naturally to an abstract `DV_ENCAPSULATED` class, with two subtypes,
`DV_PARSABLE`, for all content which is syntactic in nature, and `DV_MULTIMEDIA` for everything else.
Note that it is possible to imagine parsable content items which are large, stored in compressed form,
and are themselves a summary of another item elsewhere on the web; such items can for practical
purposes be represented as instances of `DV_MULTIMEDIA`, rather than `DV_PARSABLE`. The vast
majority of parsable encapsulated data are expected to be short and stored in native textual form, e.g.
fragments of XML or HTML.

The formal model of the classes `DV_ENCAPSULATED` and `DV_MULTIMEDIA` are closely based on the
ED type from the HL7v3 data types specification.

=== Examples

The following examples show how to use the classes to represent some common encapsulated data types.
