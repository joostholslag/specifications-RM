= Generic Package

== Overview

The classes presented in this section are abstractions of concepts which are generic patterns in the domain of health (and most likely other domains), such as 'participation' and 'attestation'. The generic cluster is shown below.

== Design Principles

=== Referring to Demographic Entities

There are two ways to refer to a demographic identity in the openEHR EHR: using `PARTY_REF` directly, which records an identifier of the party in some external system, and using `PARTY_PROXY`, consisting of a small amount of descriptive data, depending on the subtype, and an optional `PARTY_REF`. The semantics of `PARTY_REF` are described in the {openehr_base_types}[Base Types `identification` package], while the semantics of `PARTY_PROXY` and use of `PARTY_REF` in such entities are described below. The approach taken in openEHR for representing demographic and user entities in the EHR data isbased on the following assumptions:

* there is at least one human readable name or official identifier of the party, such as `"Julius Marlowe, MD"`, `"NHS provider number 1039385"`, or a system user id such as `"Rahil.Azam"`;
* there might be data in a service external to the EHR for the party in question, such as a demographic, identity management or patient index service; if there is, it should be referenceable;
* the subject of the record is never to be identified in any direct way (i.e. via the use of her name or other human-readable details), but may include a meaningless identifier in some external system.

The `PARTY_PROXY` class and subtypes model references to parties based on these assumptions. The semantics of `PARTY_PROXY` enable a flexible approach: in stricter environments that have identity management and demographic services, and where there is an entry in such a service for the party in question, `PARTY_PROXY._external_ref_` will be non-Void, while in other environments, it will be empty.

The two subtypes correspond to the mutually distinct categories of the 'subject of the record', known as the 'self' party in openEHR, and any other party. Whenever the record subject has to be referred to in the record, an instance of `PARTY_SELF` is used, while `PARTY_IDENTIFIED` is used for all other situations. The latter class provides for optional human-readable names and formal identifiers, each keyed by purpose or meaning.

The `PARTY_RELATED` type is used whenever the relationship of the party to the record subject is required. Relationships are coded and include familial ones ('mother', 'uncle', etc) as well as relationships like 'donor', 'travelling companion' and so on.

==== PARTY_SELF and Referring to the Patient from the EHR

There are three schemes which are likely to be used for referring to patient (i.e. the record subject) demographic or patient master index (PMI) data from within the EHR, each likely to be valid in different circumstances. Each uses a `PARTY_SELF` object but with varying usage of the external_ref attribute, and are as follows.

* The `_external_ref_` attribute is not set on any instances of `PARTY_SELF`, i.e. nowhere in the EHR. This is the most secure approach, and means that the link between the EHR and the patient has to be done outside the EHR, by associating `EHR._ehr_id_` and the patient demographic/ PMI identifier. This approach is more likely in more open data sharing environments.
* The `_external_ref_` attribute is set once only in `EHR_STATUS._subject_`. Since the `EHR_STATUS` object is separate from the EHR contents, the root instance of `PARTY_SELF` will generally not be visible.
* Setting the external_ref in every instance of `PARTY_SELF`; this solution makes the patient external_ref visible in every instance of `PARTY_SELF`, which is reasonable in a secure environment, and convenient for copying parts of the record around locally.

All three schemes are supported by the openEHR model, and will probably all find use in different settings and EHR deployment types.

=== Participation

The Participation abstraction models the interaction of some Party in an activity. In the openEHR reference models, participations are actually modelled in two ways. In situations where the kinds of participation are known and constant, they are modelled as a named attribute in the relevant reference model. For example, the `_committer_: PARTY_PROXY` attribute in `AUDIT_DETAILS` models a participation in which the function is "committal". Where the kind of participation is not known at design time, a descendant of the generic `PARTICIPATION` class is used.

=== Audit Information

==== Audit Details

Three classes are provided to represent audit information. The first, `AUDIT_DETAILS` expresses the details that would be captured about a user when committing some information to a repository of some kind, which may be version controlled. It records the `system_id_`, `_committer_`, `_time_committed_`, `_change_type_` and an optoinal `_description_`.

The `_system_id_` attribute is used to record the identifier of the logical EHR repository to which the data containing the audit are committed. What constitutes a 'system' in this context is described in more detail in the {openehr_overview}#_the_ehr_system[Architecture Overview].

Committer is recorded using a `PARTY_PROXY`, allowing for `PARTY_SELF` to be used when the committer is the record subject, and for other identifying information to be included for other users, expressed using `PARTY_IDENTIFIED`. The kind of identifying information used in `PARTY_PROXY` instances in `AUDIT_DETAILS` may be different from that used in `COMPOSITION._composer_` or elsewhere, i.e. in the form of a system login identifier, e.g. `"maxime.lavache@stpatricks.health.ie"`.

==== Revision History

The classes `REVISION_HISTORY` and `REVISION_HISTORY_ITEM` express the notion of a revision history, which consists of audit items, each associated with a revision number. An instance of the `REVISION_HISTORY_ITEM` class is designed to express the information that corresponds to an item in a revision history, i.e. a list of all audits relating to some information item. The version_id is included to indicate which revision each audit corresponds to. These classes provide an interoperable definition of revision history for the `VERSIONED_OBJECT` and `AUTHORED_RESOURCE` classes.

=== Attestation

Attestation is another concept which occurs commonly in health information. An attestation is an explicit signing by one healthcare agent of particular content for various particular purposes, including:

* for authorisation of a controlled substance or procedure (e.g. sectioning of patient under mental health act);
* witnessing of content by senior clinical professional;
* indicating acknowledgement of content by intended recipient, e.g. GP who ordered a test result.

Here it is modelled as a subtype of `AUDIT_DETAILS`, meaning that it is logically a kind of audit, with additional information pertinant to the act of signing. The contents of an `ATTESTATION` are as follows:

* the identity of the attesting party (`AUDIT_DETAILS._committer_`);
* the date and time of the action of attestation (`AUDIT_DETAILS._time_committed_`);
* references to items in the record being attested to (`ATTESTATION._items_`); if this list is empty, the attestation is for the entire object (usually the content of an `ORIGINAL_VERSION`) to which the attestation is attached, otherwise the list must contain a set of paths to items within the item to which the attestation is attached;
* an optionally coded reason for attestation (`ATTESTATION._reason_`);
* an optional literal view of the content attested, e.g. a binary screen image;
* a proof of attestation in the form of a digital signature by the attesting party.

The digital signature, if present, is generated using the openPGP standard ({rfc4880}[IETF RFC 4880]) as, according to the process shown below.

.Attestation signature generation (using openPGP)
image::{diagrams_uri}/attestation_signature_generation.png[id=attestation_signature_generation, align="center", width=80%]

In this process, the attestation object is serialised into a canonical text form, and then hashed to create a digest. A digital signature is created from the hash, using the user's private key. The result is then radix-64 encoded to create an ASCII string so as to remove or reduce potential problems with subsequent communication. The openPGP standard ensures that the transformations and algorithms used to create the signature are indicated within it (i.e. the signature is self-describing).

The serialisation process works by the simple rule of serialising the entire Attestation object (note that the proof attribute will be Void at this point) into an agreed XML, {openehr_odin}[openEHR ODIN] or other text format, then applying the subsequent transformations to the serialised data, then writing the digest result back into the proof attribute.

[.tbd]
*To Be Determined*: The exact serialisation is not yet defined by openEHR, but dADL might be preferred since it has an unambiguous encoding of object structures, whereas XML libraries generate different XML from the same objects.

Normally the list of items being attested should be a single Entry or Composition, but there is nothing stopping it including fine-grained items, even though separate attestation of such items does not appear to be commensurate with good clinical information design or process.

The `_reason_` attribute is used to indicate why the attestation occurred, and is coded using the openEHR Terminology group "attestation reason", which includes values such as "authorisation" and "witnessed". The `_is_pending_` attribute marks the attestation as either having been done or awaiting completion depending on its value. This facilitates querying the record to find items needing to be signed or witnessed. When an attestation is required, the most common scenario will be that a Composition Version will be committed with a `_commit_audit_` of type `ATTESTATION`, rather than just `AUDIT_DETAILS`; the `_is_pending_` flag will be set to True to indicate that the committed information needs to be signed by another person. When signing occurs, it will cause a new `ATTESTATION` object to be added to the `VERSION._attestations_` list, this time with `_is_pending_` set to False, and the appropriate proof supplied. Thus, the common situation in which content is committed to the record and needs later review and signing by a senior person will cause the creation of two `ATTESTATION` objects.
