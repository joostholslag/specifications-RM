= Tags Package

== Overview

The `common.tags` package defines the structure and semantics of a _tag_ construct that may be used within openEHR, in a similar way to 'tagging' facilities commonly available in web-based email, forum platforms, and other content management systems. The following UML diagram shows the formal model.

== Semantics

A _tag_ in openEHR is a lightweight annotation that may be associated with any information item, such that _searching_ or _querying_ for a tag will result in retrieval of the items marked with that tag. A tag consists of a _key_ and optional _value_. Here, 'searching' is understood as a function available on a service interface for the tagged content (e.g. EHR service API), while 'querying' is the use of tags in queries expressed in an openEHR query language such as {openehr_query_aql}[AQL^].

Tags are normally associated with an 'owner' object, identified by `_owner_id_`, such that deletion or move of the owner results in deletion or move of the associated tags.
