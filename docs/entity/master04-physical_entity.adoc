= Physical Entity Package

== Issues

* device 'type' versus device; prosthesis 'type' versus prosthesis etc. Current approach would be to handle via distinct hierarchies of archetypes for Device type and Device.
* Should OBJECT_AGGREGATE.parts be a collection of ENTITY_REL?

== Overview

Following BFO, openEHR Physical entities are understood as entities found within physical existence, and include material objects of any kind (Material entities); spaces and spatial extents, and processes, including events etc.
