= Social Entity Package

== Overview

Social entities are understood as entities whose identity, status, type etc are created within the social realm, via legal, commercial or informal social means. Social entities have a physical host of some Physical entity (which may include non-material entities like spaces).

In BFO terms, Social entities roughly correspond to `BFO:role`, but for pragmatic reasons, are not considered dependent entities as `BFO:role` is, i.e. their material bearers are not usually recorded or of interest.

In this model, Social entities are of two types: Parties and Assets.
