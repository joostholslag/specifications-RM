== Requirements

Getting data in and out of the EHR is one of the most basic requirements openEHR aims to satisfy. In
"greenfield" (new build) situations, and for data being created by GUI applications via the openEHR
EHR APIs, there is no issue, since native openEHR structures and semantics are being used. In almost
all other situations, existing data sources and sinks have to be accounted for. In general, external or
'legacy' data (here the term is used for convenience, and does not imply anything about the age or
quality of the systems in question) have different syntactic and semantic formats than openEHR data,
and seamless conversion requires addressing both levels.

Typical examples of legacy data sources and sinks include relational databases, HL7v2 messages, and
HL7 CDA documents. HL7v2 messages are probably one of the most common sources of pathology
messages in many countries; EDIFACT messages are another. More recently, HL7v2 messages have
been designed for referrals and even discharge summaries. Not all legacy systems are standardised;
many if not most hospitals as well as GP and other desktop products have their own private models of
data and terminology usage. Technically speaking, there is not much difference between standardised
and non-standardised legacy models; only the reusability of the solution differs.

Another important category of externally sourced data addressed by the Integration package
described here is data expressed in a form of a {iso_13606}[ISO 13606 Extract^]. Part 1 of ISO 13606 defines a
information model which is nearly identical to that of openEHR at the `COMPOSITION` and `SECTION`
levels. The ISO 13606 `Entry` class is a generic structure with a minimum of contextual metadata,
and can easily be mapped to the openEHR Entry type described in this specification.

The primary need with respect to legacy data is to be able to convert data from multiple mutually
incompatible sources into a single, standardised patient-centric EHR for each patient, that can then be
longitudinally viewed and queried. This is what enables GP and specialist notes, diagnoses and plans
to be integrated with laboratory results from multiple sources, patient notes, administrative data and
so on, to provide a coherent record of the patient journey.

In technical terms, a number of types of incompatibility have to be dealt with. There is no guarantee
of correspondence of scope of incoming transactions and target openEHR structures - an incoming
document for example might correspond to a number of clinical archetypes. Structure will not usually
correspond, with legacy data (particularly messages) usually having flatter structures than those
defined in target archetypes. Terminology use is extremely variable in existing systems and messages,
and also has to be dealt with. Data types will also not correspond directly, so that for example, a mapping
between an incoming string "110/80 mmHg" and the target openEHR form of two
`DV_QUANTITY` objects each with their own value and units has to be made.

== Design Basis

=== Overview

The design basis for connecting existing systems to openEHR is founded upon a clear separation of
the syntactic and semantic transformations required on data. The syntactic transformation converts
source data from its original form (or whatever intermediate form it may have been converted to) to a
format obeying a special class in the openEHR reference model, but whose logical structure and
semantics are controlled by 'integration' archetypes so as to mimic the design of the source data. This
step brings the data into the openEHR computational context. The second step causes transformation
on this intermediate openEHR data into data which are a) instances of the main openEHR reference
model, and b) obey 'designed' clinical archetypes.

The additional elements of the openEHR architecture which make this transformation possible are:

* a class `GENERIC_ENTRY`, which is a sibling of `SECTION` and `ENTRY`, and contains completely generic, archetypable structures;
* 'integration' archetypes, i.e. archetypes defined against the `GENERIC_ENTRY` class;
* semantic transformation rules from openEHR data based on `GENERIC_ENTRY` and integration archetypes to data based on the subtypes of `ENTRY`, and designed archetypes.

The figure below illustrates the `rm.integration` package, which contains a single class
`GENERIC_ENTRY`. Unlike other classes in the openEHR reference model, `GENERIC_ENTRY` contains
no hard-wired attributes at all, only one generic attribute, `_data_`. No assumptions at all are made about
the actual shape of such data.

=== Semantics of GENERIC_ENTRY

A number of useful consequences follow from this modelling approach. Firstly, instances of
`GENERIC_ENTRY` will contain attributes inherited from the `LOCATABLE` class, including
`_archetype_node_id_`, and are thus archetypable in the same way as all other classes in the openEHR
reference model. The `LOCATABLE` attribute feeder_audit is also inherited, and may be used to mark
every node of data with relevant meta-data from the source system record or message. Secondly, as a
subtype of `CONTENT_ITEM`, `GENERIC_ENTRY` is a valid value for `COMPOSITION`.`_content_`. This is a
completely desirable situation, since the same rules apply to `GENERIC_ENTRY` as to other content:
instances can only be committed to the record as part of a `COMPOSITION` instance. `GENERIC_ENTRY`
data are thus audit-trailed and versioned in the normal way. Thirdly, `GENERIC_ENTRY` instances can
occur within a hierarchy of `SECTIONs`, which is useful for data sources which have headings or section
equivalents (this is quite common in hospital information systems containing physician notes).
Lastly, in common with all other openEHR data, design-time paths can be constructed for archetypes
of `GENERIC_ENTRY`, while runtime paths can be extracted from data based on such archetypes. These
path sets can be used for writing the data transformation rules.

It should be remembered that while `GENERIC_ENTRY` provides a standardised syntactic form for
externally sourced data within openEHR, it provides no semantic coherence. This is particularly true
for `GENERIC_ENTRY` instances sourced from numerous data sources: there is no guarantee that the
`GENERIC_ENTRY` representations of "cholesterol result" from system A will be congruent with those
sourced from system B. It is not even required that the data sources be vastly different for this problem
to occur. Examples of messages can be found coming from different pathology laboratories,
which obey the same minor version of HL7v2 (e.g. 2.3.1) and supposedly implement the same message
type (e.g. "complete blood picture") but which differ in actual structure and content.
The consequence of this situation is that `GENERIC_ENTRY` data cannot in general be safely used for
clinical computation (e.g. decision support), and will not in general even support reliable clinical querying.
In other words, a repository of `GENERIC_ENTRYs` (within appropriate `COMPOSITION` structures)
does not constitute a reliable or interoperable health record - it can only be considered a
standardised health information data store whose primary purpose is as the input to or output of
semantic conversion processes, or for other auditing or non-clinical data management purposes.

=== Use with openEHR Extracts

The `GENERIC_ENTRY` class provides a way to represent data from non-openEHR systems that implement
the openEHR Extract specification in order to either communicate with openEHR systems, or to
communicate with other systems also implementing the openEHR Extract specification.

=== Integration with ISO 13606

The `GENERIC_ENTRY` class provides a convenient basis for making openEHR systems ISO 13606-
compliant, which in turn gives openEHR a gateway capability in heterogeneous environments where
ISO 13606 is being used to communicate data. A ISO 13606 EHR Extract can be converted to a
series of `COMPOSITIONs` containing `GENERIC_ENTRY` objects which obey appropriate integration
archetypes; this data can then be semantically converted into orthodox openEHR objects for integration
into a coherent EHR. Similarly, openEHR data can be converted into the `GENERIC_ENTRY`-based
intermediate form for further conversion into ISO 13606 EHR Extracts.

== Data Conversion Architecture

The integration archetype-based strategy for importing data into an openEHR system, shown in the following figure, consists of two steps.

[.text-center]
.Data Integration using openEHR
image::{diagrams_uri}/integration_environment.png[id=integration_environment, align="center", width=80%]

Firstly, data are converted from their original syntactic format into openEHR `COMPOSITION`/`SECTION`/
`GENERIC_ENTRY` structures, shown in the openEHR integration switch. Most of the data will
appear in the `GENERIC_ENTRY` part, controlled by an integration archetype designed to mimic the
incoming structure (such as an HL7v2 lab message) as closely as possible; `FEEDER_AUDIT` structures
are used to contain integration meta-data. The result of this step is data that are expressed in the
openEHR type system (i.e. as instances of the openEHR reference model), and are immediately amenable
to processing with normal openEHR software.

In the second step, semantic transformation is effected, by the use of mappings between integration
and designed archetypes. Such mappings are created by archetype authors using tools. The mapping
rules are the key to defining structural transformations, use of terminological codes, and other
changes. Serious challenges of course remain in the business of integrating heterogeneous systems;
some of these are dealt with in the Common IM document sections on Feeder systems.
