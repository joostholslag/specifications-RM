= Item Structure Package

== Overview

The `item_structure` package classes presented here are a formalisation of the need for generic, archetypable
data structures, and are used by all openEHR reference models.

The subtypes of the `ITEM_STRUCTURE` class explicitly model the logical data structure types which
typically occur in health record data, and include `ITEM_SINGLE` (for single values such as a patient
weight), `ITEM_LIST` (for lists such as parts of an address), `ITEM_TREE` (for hierarchically structured
data such as a microbiology report) and `ITEM_TABLE` (for tabular data such as visual acuity or reflex
test results). Each of these classes defines a functional interface, has an optimal physical representation
using the basic types `CLUSTER` and `ELEMENT` from the `representation` package, and can generate
a CEN EN13606-compliant hierarchical representation of its data. Any system implementing
these types is guaranteed to create data which represents the logical structures of lists, tables and trees
identically.

Data values are connected to spatial structures via the `_value_` attribute of the `ELEMENT` class of the
`representation` cluster. This class also carries an important attribute `_null_flavour_`, whose value indicates
how to read the value. A small domain termlist containing values such as "unknown", "not disclosed",
"undetermined", etc, as described in the Flavours of Null vocabulary in the openEHR
Support Information Model.

The openEHR class model for spatial structures is illustrated on the right-hand side of <<_data_structures_package>>. It
should be noted that these classes (`ITEM_LIST` etc) are not equivalents of similarly named classes
(such as `List<T>`) in most data structure libraries - they also include per-node `_name_`,
`_archetype_node_id_` and leaf node value and null flavour, and path capabilities.

== CEN EN13606 Encoding Rules

=== ITEM_SINGLE
An `ITEM_SINGLE` object is encoded in EN13606 as a single `ELEMENT` object.

=== ITEM_LIST
An `ITEM_LIST` object is encoded in EN13606 as a `CLUSTER` object containing the set of `ELEMENTs`
from the openEHR list.

=== ITEM_TABLE
The `ITEM_TABLE` encoding rules are as follows:

* Each row is encoded as a Cluster containing a number of `ELEMENTs`, each corresponding to the value of a column in that row.
* An empty/void column value for a row is represented by an `ELEMENT` containing no value, and with `_null_flavour_` set.
* The names of the `ELEMENT` in a row are the column names.
* The names of the containing `CLUSTER` of each row is the stringified number of the row in the overall table.

=== ITEM_TREE
Data of an `ITEM_TREE` instance are simply replicated as is to produce the correct EN13606 hierarchical form.
