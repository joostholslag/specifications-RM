= Representation Package

== Overview

This package contains classes for a simple hierarchical representation of any data structure, as shown
on the lower right side of <<_data_structures_package>>. These classes are compatible with the CEN EN13606 classes of
the same names, and instances can be losslessly generated to and from EN13606 instances structures.
