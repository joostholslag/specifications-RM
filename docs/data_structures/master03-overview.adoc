= Overview

The `rm.data_structures` package contains two packages: the `item_structure` package and
the `history` package. The first describes generic, path-addressable data structures, while the latter
describes a generic notion of linear history, for recording events in past time. The
`data_structures package` is illustrated in the UML diagram below.

The `data_structures package` itself contains a single class, `DATA_STRUCTURE`, which is the
ancestor of all openEHR data structures. Its only feature is the function as_hierarchy, which is implemented
by each subtype of `DATA_STRUCTURE`, in order to generate a physical representation of the
structure in ISO 13606 form. The ISO 13606 form is usually less optimal than the openEHR form, but
is compatible with the less semantically rich standard, and is guaranteed (in theory) to be comprehensible
to other systems which support ISO 13606 as an interoperability standard.
