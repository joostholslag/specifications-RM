= Preface

== Purpose

This document describes the openEHR EHR Information Model, which is a model of an interoperable EHR in the ISO RM/ODP information viewpoint. This model defines a logical EHR information architecture rather than just an architecture for communication of EHR extracts or documents between EHR systems. The openEHR definition of the EHR Extract is given in the openEHR EHR_EXTRACT Information Model.

The intended audience includes:

* Standards bodies producing health informatics standards;
* Academic groups using openEHR;
* The open source healthcare community;
* Solution vendors;
* Medical informaticians and clinicians interested in health information.
* Health data managers.

== Conformance

Conformance of a data or software artifact to an openEHR specification is determined by a formal test of that artifact against the relevant openEHR Implementation Technology Specification(s) (ITSs), such as an IDL interface or an XML-schema. Since ITSs are formal derivations from underlying models, ITS conformance indicates model conformance.
