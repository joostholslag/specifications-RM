h|*Class*
2+^h|*DV_BOOLEAN*

h|*Description*
2+a|Items which are truly boolean data, such as true/false or yes/no answers. For such data, it is important to devise the meanings (usually questions in subjective data)  carefully, so that the only allowed results are in fact true or false.

Misuse: The DV_BOOLEAN class should not be used as a replacement for naively modelled enumerated types such as male/female etc. Such values should be coded, and in any case the enumeration often has more than two values.
