h|*0..1*
|*time*: `@DV_INTERVAL<DV_DATE_TIME>@`
a|The time interval during which the participation took place, if it is used in an observational context (i.e. recording facts about the past); or the intended time interval of the participation when used in future contexts, such as EHR Instructions.

h|*1..1*
|*function*: `link:/releases/RM/{rm_release}/data_types.html#_dv_text_class[DV_TEXT^]`
a|The function of the Party in this participation (note that a given party might participate in more than one way in a particular activity). This attribute should be coded, but cannot be limited to the HL7v3:ParticipationFunction vocabulary, since it is too limited and hospital-oriented.

h|*0..1*
|*mode*: `link:/releases/RM/{rm_release}/data_types.html#_dv_coded_text_class[DV_CODED_TEXT^]`
a|The mode of the performer / activity interaction, e.g. present, by telephone, by email etc.

|*performer*: `link:/releases/BASE/{rm_release}/foundation_types.html#_string_class[String^]`
a|Uid of demographic entity within Extract who performed this participation.
