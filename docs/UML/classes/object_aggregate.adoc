a|Containment relation of an aggregate (non-primitive) object. The notion of 'primitive' refers to a business point of view rather than e.g. screws, transistors, or atoms. Thus, a pulse oximeter is normally considered  a non-aggregate object by a hospital that uses them, even though it would be considered an aggregate object by the manufacturer.
