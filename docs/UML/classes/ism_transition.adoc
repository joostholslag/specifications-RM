h|*Description*
2+a|Model of a transition in the Instruction State Machine, caused by a careflow step. The attributes document the careflow step as well as the ISM transition.

h|*1..1*
|*current_state*: `link:/releases/RM/{rm_release}/data_types.html#_dv_coded_text_class[DV_CODED_TEXT^]`
a|The ISM current state. Coded by openEHR terminology group Instruction states.

h|*0..1*
|*transition*: `link:/releases/RM/{rm_release}/data_types.html#_dv_coded_text_class[DV_CODED_TEXT^]`
a|The ISM transition which occurred to arrive in the current_state. Coded by openEHR terminology group  Instruction transitions.

h|*0..1*
|*careflow_step*: `link:/releases/RM/{rm_release}/data_types.html#_dv_coded_text_class[DV_CODED_TEXT^]`
a|The step in the careflow process which occurred as part of generating this action, e.g.  dispense ,  start_administration . This attribute represents the clinical  label for the activity, as  opposed to current_state which represents  the state machine (ISM)  computable form. Defined in archetype.
