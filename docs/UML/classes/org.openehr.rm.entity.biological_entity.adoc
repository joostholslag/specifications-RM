h|*Description*
2+a|Any entity containing DNA and/or RNA and primarily considered as an organism (rather than an object) or part thereof, including:

* living organisms;
* deceased organisms;
* body parts;
* tissue, including blood;
* bacteria and viruses.

Note that many objects contain RNA, such as food and most everyday objects on which bacteria can be found, but are not in themselves organisms or considered from a biological point of view. However, in a case of food poisoning determined to have as its source certain food (say, hotel sandwiches), a culture taken from the food and/or human sufferers would be considered a Biological entity.
