2+^h|*DV_QUANTITY*

h|*Description*
2+a|Quantitified type representing  scientific  quantities, i.e. quantities expressed as a magnitude and units.  Units were inspired by the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM), developed by Gunther Schadow and Clement J. McDonald of The Regenstrief Institute.

Can also be used for time durations, where it is more convenient to treat these as simply a number of seconds rather than days, months, years.

|*magnitude*: `link:/releases/BASE/{base_release}/foundation_types.html#_real_class[Real^]`
a|Numeric magnitude of the quantity.

h|*0..1*
|*precision*: `link:/releases/BASE/{base_release}/foundation_types.html#_integer_class[Integer^]`
