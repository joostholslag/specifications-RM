h|*Class*
2+^h|*DV_STATE*

h|*Description*
2+a|For representing state values which obey a defined state machine, such as a variable  representing the states of an instruction or care process.

DV_STATE is expressed as a String but its values are driven by archetype-defined  state machines. This provides a powerful way of capturing stateful complex processes  in simple data.
