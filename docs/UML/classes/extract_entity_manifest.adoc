h|*Class*
2+^h|*EXTRACT_ENTITY_MANIFEST*

h|*Description*
2+a|The manifest for one entity (e.g. EHR subject), identifying the entity and optionally specifying top-level items to be included in the Extract. The list actually included may be modified by the `_version_spec_` part of the specification, and also by the link_depth attribute. In repeat (standing order) requests, the final inclusion may be modified by the send_changes_only value for `EXTRACT_UPDATE_SPEC._update_method_`.

Various identifiers may be provided for the entity; these are to be used by the receiver system to locate the entity. The `_extract_id_key_` attribute is used to record the identifier that will be used throughout the Extract for this entity, including in instances of `EXTRACT_ENTITY_IDENTIFIER`.

a|List of Uids of items to be included in the Extract, in cases where individual items are being requested by id.
