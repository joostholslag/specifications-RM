=== DV_CODED_TEXT Class

h|*Class*
2+^h|*DV_CODED_TEXT*

h|*Description*
2+a|A text item whose value must be the rubric from a controlled terminology, the key (i.e. the  code') of which is the defining_code attribute. In other words: a DV_CODED_TEXT is a combination of a CODE_PHRASE (effectively a code) and the rubric of that term, from a terminology service, in the language in which the data was authored.

Since DV_CODED_TEXT is a subtype of DV_TEXT, it can be used in place of it, effectively allowing the type DV_TEXT to mean  a text item, which may optionally be coded.

Misuse: If the intention is to represent a term code attached in some way to a fragment of plain text, DV_CODED_TEXT should not be used; instead use a DV_TEXT and a TERM_MAPPING to a CODE_PHRASE.
