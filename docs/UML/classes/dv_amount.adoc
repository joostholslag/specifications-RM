h|*Class*
2+^h|*_DV_AMOUNT (abstract)_*

h|*Description*
2+a|Abstract class defining the concept of relative quantified  'amounts'. For relative quantities, the  `+` and  `-` operators are defined (unlike descendants of `DV_ABSOLUTE_QUANTITY`, such as the date/time types).

h|*Inherit*
2+|`DV_QUANTIFIED`

h|*Attributes*
^h|*Signature*
^h|*Meaning*

h|*0..1*
|*accuracy_is_percent*: `Boolean`
a|If `True`, indicates that when this object was created, `_accuracy_` was recorded as a percent value; if `False`, as an absolute quantity value.

h|*0..1 +
(redefined)*
|*accuracy*: `Real`
a|Accuracy of measurement, expressed either as a half-range percent value (`_accuracy_is_percent_` = `True`) or a half-range quantity. A value of `0` means that accuracy is 100%, i.e. no error.

A value of `_unknown_accuracy_value_` means that accuracy was not recorded.
h|*Functions*
^h|*Signature*
^h|*Meaning*

h|*1..1*
|*valid_percentage* ( +
number: `Ordered_Numeric[1]` +
): `Boolean`
a|Test whether a number is a valid percentage, i.e. between 0 and 100.

h|*1..1*
|*add* _alias_ "+" ( +
other: `DV_AMOUNT[1]` +
): `DV_AMOUNT` +
 +
_Pre_comparable_: `is_strictly_comparable_to (other)`
a|Sum of this amount and another. The value of accuracy in the result is either:

* the sum of the accuracies of the operands, if both present, or;
* both operand accuracies are unknown_accuracy_value.

If the accuracy value is a percentage in one operand and not in the other, the form in the result is that of the larger operand.

h|*1..1*
|*subtract* _alias_ "-" ( +
other: `DV_AMOUNT[1]` +
): `DV_AMOUNT` +
 +
_Pre_comparable_: `is_strictly_comparable_to (other)`
a|Difference of this amount and another. The value of `_accuracy_` in the result is either:

* the sum of the accuracies of the operands, if both present, or;
* unknown, if either or both operand accuracies are unknown.

If the `_accuracy_` value is a percentage in one operand and not in the other, the form in the result is that of the larger operand.

h|*1..1 +
(effected)*
|*is_equal* ( +
other: `DV_AMOUNT[1]` +
): `Boolean`
a|Return True if this `DV_AMOUNT` is considered equal to `_other_`.

h|*1..1*
|*multiply* _alias_ "&#42;" ( +
factor: `Real[1]` +
): `DV_AMOUNT`
a|Product of this Amount and `_factor_`.

h|*1..1*
|*negative* _alias_ "-" (): `DV_AMOUNT`
a|Negated version of current object, such as used for representing a difference, e.g. a weight loss.

h|*1..1 +
(effected)*
|*less_than* _alias_ "<" ( +
other: `DV_AMOUNT[1]` +
): `Boolean` +
 +
_Post_result_: `Result = magnitude < other.magnitude`
a|True if this object is less than `_other_`. Based on comparison of `_magnitude_`.

h|*Invariants*
2+a|_Accuracy_is_percent_validity_: `accuracy = 0 implies not accuracy_is_percent`

h|
2+a|_Accuracy_validity_: `accuracy_is_percent implies valid_percentage (accuracy)`
